# hexglobus
An experiment in hexmapping

v0.1 is an HTML5 webpage that can display a small hexmap, with the following interactions:

- See the coordinates and scale of the hex in the center of view
- Set coordinates and scale to go to a different hex.
- Toggle the grid for multiple scales, stroke width, color, transparency.
- Underlay an image that is locked to specific hex coordinates and moves/scales with the grid.

Hexes at (0, 0) are concentric at all scales, scale 0 being the smallest, 1 being twice as long, and so on. See hex-example.svg - the page https://dqmusings.blogspot.com/2017/03/mapping-with-master-hexes.html refers to sese as "Category 1".
